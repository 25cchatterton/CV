    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>I am a student a Sunset Jr. High in 9th grade. I am taking an exploring computer science class for high school credit. Some things that I like to do at school is musicals. I love being in musicals because you can learn about how theatre is put on and you get to be with friends. Musical is probably one of my favorite classes because I like to be a part of musical productions.</p>
    <p>I am a part of a family of 6, I have 3 sisters and no bothers. Some things that I like to do outside from school is dance, jump on the tramp, and do puzzles. Right now, I am going to Studio 48 for dance. I love being outside and jumping on the tramp is one enjoyable thing I do outside. I have always loved puzzles; I think they are fun and entertaining. I love hands on things and live a happy life.</p>
